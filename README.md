# E-Commerce Database Design

## üéØ Objective
This project involves designing an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and building the corresponding e-commerce database schema from scratch. The goal is to create a relational database structure that supports an online store, encompassing products, categories, attributes, variations, and more.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **MySQL**: Database management system used for creating tables.
- **dbdiagram.io**: Tool used to create the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaborative development.

## üóÉÔ∏è Project Structure

### Tables:
- **brand**: Stores brand information.
- **product_category**: Categorizes products (e.g., clothing, electronics).
- **product**: Main product information including price, brand, and category.
- **product_item**: Specific purchasable items, including stock and SKU.
- **product_image**: Stores URLs or references for product images.
- **color**: Manages product color options.
- **product_variation**: Links products to specific variations (e.g., size, color).
- **size_category**: Defines general size categories (e.g., clothing sizes).
- **size_option**: Specific size options like S, M, L, or numerical shoe sizes.
- **product_attribute**: Stores additional product details like material, weight.
- **attribute_category**: Groups product attributes into categories.
- **attribute_type**: Defines types of product attributes (e.g., text, number).
